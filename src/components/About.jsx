      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to LowBall Motors—where making an offer is less about haggling
        and more about hilarious hijinks! We believe car shopping shouldn't be
        stressful; it should be as entertaining as watching your neighbor
        negotiate their cable bill.
      </p>
      <p>
        At LowBall Motors, we’re redefining the art of the offer with our
        Ridiculous LowBall Button™. Feeling bold? Push the button and watch as
        we serve up an offer so low it'll make your grandma's coupon clipping
        look like child's play. Sure, we might not always accept the offer (hey,
        we have to keep the lights on), but we promise it’ll make you laugh—and
        isn’t laughter priceless? Well, not here, because we aim to save you
        cash, too.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here’s how it works:
        <ul>
          <ol>1. Find a car you love (we won't judge if you name it).</ol>
          <ol>2. Make a serious offer—or don't, we dare you</ol>
          <ol>3. Press the LowBall Button and let the absurdity begin.</ol>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We're all about making car buying accessible, enjoyable, and just the
          right amount of ridiculous. Whether you're here to snag a great deal
          or just for the thrill of the lowball experience, you're in the right
          place.
        </p>
        <p>
          So buckle up, folks. LowBall Motors isn’t just a dealership—it’s a
          destination. A place where boldness meets bargains, and every offer
          has a chance (no matter how slim) of becoming legendary.
